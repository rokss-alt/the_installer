Duplicity is another powerful tool that builds on Rsync, but adds encryption features to protect the backups. It allows you to encrypt your backup copies, ensuring that sensitive data remains secure even if stored on remote servers, FTP sites, or cloud services like Amazon S3. Duplicity provides an extra layer of security while maintaining Rsync's efficient data transfer capabilities.
