- `ext2` is an older file system with no journaling capabilities, which makes it less suited for modern systems but still useful in certain low-overhead scenarios (like USB drives).

- `ext3` and `ext4` are more advanced, with journaling (which helps in recovering from crashes), and ext4 is the default choice for most modern Linux systems because it offers a balance of performance, reliability, and large file support.

- `Btrfs` is known for advanced features like snapshotting and built-in data integrity checks, making it ideal for complex storage setups.

- `XFS` excels at handling large files and has high performance. It is best suited for environments with high I/O demands

- `NTFS`, originally developed for Windows, is useful for compatibility when dealing with dual-boot systems or external drives that need to work on both Linux and Windows systems.




In Linux, files can be stored in one of several key types:

- Regular files
- Directories
- Symbolic links
