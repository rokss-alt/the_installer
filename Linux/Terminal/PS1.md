The PS1 variable in Linux systems controls how your command prompt looks in the terminal. It's like a template that defines the text you see each time the system is ready for you to type a command. By customizing the PS1 variable, you can change the prompt to display information such as your username, your computer's name, the current folder you're in, or even add colors and special characters. This allows you to personalize the command-line interface to make it more informative or visually appealing.
