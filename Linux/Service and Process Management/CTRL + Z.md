Sometimes it will be necessary to put the scan or process we just started in the background to continue using the current session to interact with the system or start other processes. As we have already seen, we can do this with the shortcut `[Ctrl + Z]`.

We can check current jobs by using [[jobs]]

The `[Ctrl] + Z` shortcut suspends the processes, and they will not be executed further. To keep it running in the background, we have to enter the command `bg` to put the process in the background.
