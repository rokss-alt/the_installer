Rsync is an open-source tool that allows for fast and secure backups, whether locally or to a remote location. One of its key advantages is that it only transfers the portions of files that have changed, making it highly efficient when dealing with large amounts of data. Rsync is particularly useful for network transfers, such as syncing files between servers or creating incremental backups over the internet.
