`RBAC` (Role-Based Access Control) gives users permissions based on their `roles` in an organization. Instead of assigning access directly to each person, you assign it to a role—like `manager`, `developer`, or `analyst`—and then assign users to those roles.

This makes it easier to manage who can do what, reduces mistakes, and ensures people only have access to what they need for their job. RBAC helps protect sensitive data, limits damage from security issues, and supports following `regulations`.

Unlike `DAC`, where the file owner controls access, RBAC is more `flexible` and `scalable`. It works especially well in big environments like companies, government agencies, or banks where there are lots of users and resources.
