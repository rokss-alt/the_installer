`DAC` (Discretionary Access Control) is an important part of modern security. It helps organizations manage who can access their resources and reduce the risk of unauthorized access. With DAC, the person who owns a file or resource gets to decide who else can use it and what they’re allowed to do. They can set permissions for actions like `read`, `write`, `execute`, or `delete`. It’s one of the most common ways to control access in computer systems.
