`Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux)` is a `mandatory access control` ([[MAC]]) system built into the Linux kernel. It gives very detailed control over what processes and files can do by using `security policies`. These policies set the permissions for every process and file on the system, which helps limit the damage if something gets compromised.

Since SELinux works deep in the system, it offers strong security. However, because it controls things at such a detailed level, it can be tricky to set up and manage.
