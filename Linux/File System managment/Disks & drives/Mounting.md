Every storage drive or partition needs to be connected to a folder in the system so you can use it. This is called `mounting`. When you mount a drive, you link it to a specific folder (called a _mount point_), and after that, you can use it just like any other folder on the computer.

if you want certain file systems or partitions to be automatically mounted when the system boots, you can define them in the `/etc/fstab` file.
