`cURL` is a tool that allows us to transfer files from the shell over protocols like `HTTP`, `HTTPS`, `FTP`, `SFTP`, `FTPS`, or `SCP`, and in general, gives us the possibility to control and test websites remotely via command line. Besides the remote servers' content, we can also view individual requests to look at the client's and server's communication. Usually, `cURL` is already installed on most Linux systems. This is another critical reason to familiarize ourselves with this tool, as it can make some processes much easier later on.
