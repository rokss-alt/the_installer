The `iptables` utility offers a flexible way to filter network traffic based on various criteria like IP addresses, port numbers, and protocols. There are other options too, such as `nftables`, `ufw`, and `firewalld`.

- **Nftables** is a newer alternative to `iptables`, offering improved performance and a more modern syntax. However, its rule syntax is not compatible with `iptables`, so moving from `iptables` to `nftables` requires some adjustments.
    
- **UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)** is built on top of `iptables` and provides a simpler, more user-friendly way to configure firewall rules, making it easier to manage firewall settings.
    
- **FirewallD** offers a dynamic firewall solution with a rich set of rules. It supports creating custom firewall zones and services, allowing you to manage complex configurations more flexibly.
