These logs contain information about user authentication attempts, including successful and failed attempts. They are stored in the `/var/log/auth.log` file. It is important to note that while the `/var/log/syslog` file may contain similar login information, the `/var/log/auth.log` file specifically focuses on user authentication attempts, making it a more valuable resource for identifying potential security threats. Therefore, it is essential for penetration testers to review the logs stored in the `/var/log/auth.log` file to ensure that the system is secure and has not been compromised.

Feb 28 2023 18:15:01 sshd[5678]: Accepted publickey for admin from 10.14.15.2 port 43210 ssh2: RSA SHA256:+KjEzN2cVhIW/5uJpVX9n5OB5zVJ92FtCZxVzzcKjw

Feb 28 2023 18:15:12 kernel: [  778.941871] firewall: unexpected traffic allowed on port 22
Feb 28 2023 18:15:15 auditd[9876]: Audit daemon started successfully
Feb 28 2023 18:15:18 systemd-logind[1234]: New session 4321 of user admin.
Feb 28 2023 18:15:21 CRON[2345]: pam_unix(cron:session): session opened for user root by (uid=0)
Feb 28 2023 18:15:24 CRON[2345]: pam_unix(cron:session): session closed for user root
```

In this example, we can see in the first line that a successful public key has been used for authentication for the user `admin`. Additionally, we can see that this user is in the `sudoers` group because he can execute commands using `sudo`. The kernel message indicates that unexpected traffic was allowed on port 22, which could indicate a potential security breach. After that, we see that a new session was created for user "admin" by `systemd-logind` and that a `cron` session opened and closed for the user `root`.
