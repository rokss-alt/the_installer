A Virtual Private Network (`VPN`) functions like a secure, invisible tunnel that connects us to another network, allowing seamless and protected access as if we were physically present within it. This is achieved by establishing an encrypted tunnel between the client and the server, ensuring that all data transmitted through this connection remains confidential and safeguarded from unauthorized access.
