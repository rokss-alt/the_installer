Remote desktop protocols let you access and control another computer’s desktop over a network, using a graphical interface. They work on Windows, Linux, and macOS, and are especially useful for system administrators who need to manage, troubleshoot, or update systems without being physically present.

To do this, admins connect to the remote system using the protocol that fits the operating system they’re working with. For example, when installing software or performing maintenance on a remote system, the admin uses one of the following:

- **Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)**: Mostly used for Windows. [[RDP]] lets admins connect to a Windows computer and use it as if they were sitting right in front of it.
    
- **Virtual Network Computing (VNC)**: Often used with Linux, but works across platforms. [[VNC]] gives graphical access to remote desktops, allowing admins to manage Linux systems similarly to how [[RDP]] works with Windows.
    

You can think of remote desktop protocols like having different keys for different types of buildings. [[RDP]] is like a key made specifically for Windows buildings, giving full access to the rooms (desktops). [[VNC]] is more like a universal key—it works in many places, but it’s most often used for Linux buildings. Just like you’d use the right key for the building you're entering, admins choose the right protocol based on the system they need to manage.
