`TCP wrappers` are a host-based network access control tool that restricts access to network services based on the `IP address` of incoming connections. When a network request comes in, TCP wrappers intercept it and check it against a list of allowed or denied IPs. This makes it an effective way to control access, especially for blocking unauthorized systems from connecting to networked resources. While it doesn’t offer the fine control of [[SELinux]] or [[AppArmor]], TCP wrappers are great for basic network protection.

All three security mechanisms—[[SELinux]], [[AppArmor]], and `TCP wrappers`—share the common goal of protecting Linux systems. They help reduce the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches by restricting access to resources and services. These tools are also readily available in most Linux distributions, so they are easily accessible for strengthening system security. Additionally, they can be customized and configured using standard tools, making them convenient for Linux users.

Though both [[SELinux]] and [[AppArmor]] are [[MAC]] systems with detailed control, they work in different ways. [[SELinux]] is deeply integrated into the kernel and offers very fine-grained security controls, but it can be complex to configure and manage. On the other hand, [[AppArmor]] is easier to manage, using profile-based security, but it doesn’t provide the same level of detail as [[SELinux]].

Meanwhile, `TCP wrappers` focus on controlling access to network services based on client IP addresses. This makes it simpler but limited to network-level access control. While it doesn’t provide the broader protections for system resources like [[SELinux]] and [[AppArmor]], it’s useful for blocking unauthorized access to services.
