Containerization means running apps in their own isolated spaces called `containers`. These containers are lightweight and make sure the app works the same way no matter where you run it. Tools like `Docker` and `LXC` help make this possible, especially on Linux. Unlike virtual machines, containers share the systemâ€™s core (the `kernel`), so they use fewer resources and run faster. Containers also make it easier to build, move, and manage apps safely and efficiently.
