`symlinks` - allow quick access to files located in different parts of the file system without duplicating the file itself.



Each category of user can have different permission levels. For example, the owner of a file may have permission to read, write, and execute it, while others may only have read access. These permissions are independent for each category, meaning changes to one userâ€™s permissions do not necessarily affect others.
