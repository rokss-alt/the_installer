Secure Shell (`SSH`) is a network protocol that allows the secure transmission of data and commands over a network. It is widely used to securely manage remote systems and securely access remote systems to execute commands or transfer files. In order to connect to our or a remote Linux host via SSH, a corresponding SSH server must be available and running.

OpenSSH can be configured and customized by editing the file `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` with a text editor. Here we can adjust settings such as the maximum number of concurrent connections, the use of passwords or keys for logins, host key checking, and more. However, it is important for us to note that changes to the OpenSSH configuration file must be done carefully.
