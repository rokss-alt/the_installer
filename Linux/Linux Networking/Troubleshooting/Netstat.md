When using this tool, you’ll get detailed info about each `network connection`. This includes things like the `protocol` used (e.g., TCP or UDP), how many `bytes` were sent and received, the `IP addresses` and `port numbers` for both your device and the remote one, and the current `connection state`.

The output can show active and listening connections. For example, you might see:

- `VNC` (remote desktop)
    
- `Sun RPC` (remote procedure calls)
    
- `HTTP` (web traffic)
    
- `SSH` (secure remote access)
    

Knowing which `ports` are used by which services helps you spot issues and fix them faster.

During `penetration testing`, the most common network problems you’ll run into are:

- `Network connectivity` issues
    
- `DNS` resolution problems (seriously, it’s always DNS)
    
- `Packet loss`
    
- `Slow network performance`
    

And the usual causes are:

- Misconfigured `firewalls` or `routers`
    
- Broken or damaged `network cables`
    
- Wrong `network settings`
    
- `Hardware failures`
    
- Bad `DNS server settings` or `DNS outages`
    
- Wrong `DNS entries`
    
- `Network congestion`
    
- Old or misconfigured `network hardware`
    
- Missing `patches` or `security controls`
    

Understanding these problems and what causes them is key when you're testing networks for weaknesses.
