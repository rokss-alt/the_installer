`Linux Containers (LXC)` is a lightweight way to run multiple separate Linux systems—called `containers`—on one computer. It uses tools like `cgroups` and `namespaces` to make sure each container stays isolated and works on its own.

Unlike traditional `virtual machines`, LXC containers don’t need a full operating system for each one—they share the same system core (`kernel`), making them faster and more efficient.

| `Approach`       | LXC is often seen as a more traditional, system-level containerization tool, focusing on creating isolated Linux environments that behave like lightweight virtual machines. Docker, on the other hand, is application-focused, meaning it is optimized for packaging and deploying single applications or microservices.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `Image building` | Docker uses a standardized image format (Docker images) that includes everything needed to run an application (code, libraries, configurations). LXC, while capable of similar functionality, typically requires more manual setup for building and managing environments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `Portability`    | Docker excels in portability. Its container images can be easily shared across different systems via Docker Hub or other registries. LXC environments are less portable in this sense, as they are more tightly integrated with the host system’s configuration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `Easy of use`    | Docker is designed with simplicity in mind, offering a user-friendly CLI and extensive community support. LXC, while powerful, may require more in-depth knowledge of Linux system administration, making it less straightforward for beginners.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `Security`       | Docker containers are generally more secure out of the box, thanks to additional isolation layers like AppArmor and SELinux, along with its read-only filesystem feature. LXC containers, while secure, may need additional configurations to match the level of isolation Docker offers by default. Interestingly enough, when misconfigured, both Docker and LXC can present a vector for local privilege escalation (these techniques are covered in depth in our [Linux Local Privlege Escalation module](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/51). |
